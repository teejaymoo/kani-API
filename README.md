# kani-API

This is Kani-API! You can use our API to access data for a user's account and a ton general reference data for the subjects within Bagu.

This API is built around a RESTful structure, with consistent, resource-oriented URLs. We support that structure with standard HTTP features: HTTP verbs for all our endpoints to indicate different actions, HTTP authentication headers, and HTTP response codes to indicate both success and various errors. We've turned on cross-origin resource sharing to allow for secure client-side access. We respond to all requests with JSON, making it easy to parse those responses into native objects in a variety of languages. These should open up the API to any client that supports these features and data structures.
